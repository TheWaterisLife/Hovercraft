ðŸŒŸ Exciting Project Showcase: Hovercraft Engineering Triumph! ðŸŒŸ

I am thrilled to share the incredible journey and success of our hovercraft project, which culminated in us securing 1st place in the ENGR 290 competition! ðŸš€

Working as part of Team #6 alongside my talented peers Batu Erata, David Girma, John Hourani, Mohammed Almasri, Nihal Islam, and under the guidance of our instructor, we embarked on this ambitious project to design, build, and operate a hovercraft capable of navigating through a complex maze using cutting-edge technology and innovative solutions.

ðŸ”§ Key Technologies & Components:

Arduino: Utilized for precise control of fans, servo motor, and sensors.
Sensors: Integrated IR sensors, IMU, and an ultrasonic sensor for accurate distance measurement and obstacle detection.
PID Control: Implemented PID algorithms for smooth and responsive navigation.
Software: Developed custom code to manage all hardware components seamlessly (available on my GitHub).
ðŸŽ¥ Project Highlights:

Autonomous Navigation: Successfully programmed the hovercraft to autonomously navigate the maze, making real-time decisions based on sensor inputs.
Innovative Design: Our design included a balance of thrust and uplift fans, ensuring stability and maneuverability.
Team Collaboration: This project was a testament to our ability to work collaboratively, combining our strengths to overcome technical challenges.

I am immensely proud of what we have achieved and grateful for the opportunity to apply and enhance my engineering skills. This project has not only been a technical success but also a learning experience that has prepared me for future challenges in the engineering field.

Looking forward to more exciting projects and opportunities to innovate and excel!
